      <h1 class="center">Code Translate</h1>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center">Identity</h2>
      <p> Our ISP is the process of translating code between different languages such as swift to C++ or Python to Java, etc. Our first conversion being from swift to C++ as that is conversion this ISP is focusing on. </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center">Problem</h2>
      <p> Some languages have qualities or attributes that better than others. And when a conversion is required, this ISP has to input in one language, and output the same algorithm in another language. The translation between languages is the challenging part of the ISP, as there are attributes in one language that cannot be translated to another, such as Swifts ability to easily convert Integers to Strings, something a language like C++ cannot do. Since this ISP has to create a perfect translation, between to programming languages without any error, the hardest part is to intake certain attributes of one language (that cannot be compiled in the desired language) and somehow compile them in the desired language. </p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center"> Our Solution</h2>
      <p>The solution is to convert a slower more easily understood language (Such as Swift), to a language that is harder to understand but is faster in optimizations of the same algorithm (C++) The output will be a website that allows the user to input a language, and then click on the convert button to obtain a converted output, in the a different language. The product will start with a conversion from Swift to C++ as Swift is a very slow but easy to understand language, while C++ is a very hard language to learn but it is much faster than swift when presented the same algorithm.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center">Target Market</h2>
      <p>Our target market, are developers who would like to optimize their algorithm to achieve faster speeds, and one way to do this is through converting languages. Especially for developers using swift to optimize their code, a language conversion to C++ would make the code speed much faster, without the need of a lot of optimization. Programmers who wish to convert legacy programs can also be a potential target in the distant future, if the project goes far enough to convert legacy programs to our modern programming languages.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center">The Competition</h2>
      <p>There are minor code converters that are free, but these converters are not perfect in converting between languages. Some attributes of one language cannot be easily translated to another language, and when a problem like this arrives the code converter just ignores it completely. This is why most code imputed in these converters is incomplete, and the algorithm in the new language is non-existent. Our goal is to improve on these shortcomings and actually create a complete converter that preserves the algorithm during conversion.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center">Revenue Streams</h2>
      <p>Funds are not really necessary as of now, but when money is needed, fundraisers, and awareness campaigns will be posted in order to raise money for our project. We can also gain money through adsense and other forms of advertising.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center">Marketing Activities</h2>
      <p> Our marketing campaigns wil be run through advertisements, in order to communicate our product to the desired audience. We would most likely use Google Ads for our product to reach to the correct demographic, and the fact that Google Ads will repeat our ads to the desired demographic.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center">Expenses</h2>
      <p>Possible expenses from can only come from our marketing campaigns. Possible marketing expenses are Google ads and domain hosting. Google Ads would come toward the end of our ISP; however only if ads are needed. In case of ads, the max ad rate would be $20 per month. Domain hosing would be necessary if we wish to move our ISP from the codermerlin sever and add advertisements to our websites. Most likely we would run a free trail on GoDaddy and enter a payment plan that would be at most $7 a month.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center"> Team and Key Roles</h2>
      <p>Currently, there are four team members: Neeraj Gogate, Vivek Maranganti, Karthik Peravali, and Evan Ye. There are no specific roles for each team member but every team member will both be a front end and back end developer. Towards the end of the project where polishing of the website occurs, our team will develop separate roles to finish off the project.</p>
      <br>
      <h2 class="center">Milestones</h2>
      <p>As the business grows, we will move into adding more support for more languages, especially ones that have more untraditional ways of making declarations and flexible rules of type casting. We will also expand on the libraries present to include the ability to create libraries that operate the way the original languages intended it.</p>
