    <h2 style="text-align: center;"> Computer Science Student in Allen High School</h2>
    
    <p style="margin-left:200px; margin-right:200px;"> Hi! My name is Karthik Peravali, and I am an aspiring computer science student in allen high school. I lived here in Allen Tx for the past 10 years. People around me call me a very aspiring student, with loads of ambition. Though I have not decided what I would major in college, the classes I took on computer science would most definetly reflect that. Other than computer science II this year, I took computer science 1 last year, which opened up the fundamentals of many computer science topics, and taught me my first computer science language, Swift! I plan on learning more languages other than Swift, but swift was my start! With swift did I build my first game which sparked popularity from my schoolmates last year. I wish to develop that game, by adding more components, to the fullest extent. Other than computer science, other classes I am taking concurrently are BC Calculus, AP Statistics, AP Physics 1, AP English III, AP US History, and AP Chemistry. I wish to use all that I learned in high school to fully devlop my college career in whatever I would major in. </p>
